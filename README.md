# Project131

My presentation reviews different AI models and compares how they are able to generate code. It tests each AI with three different tests to find each of their strengths and weaknesses, and then compares them. With this, I hope to find which AI would be most helpful in coding, and which one I would recommend for certain coding tasks.Â
